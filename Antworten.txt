Antworten den Kontrollfragen

a) . Parameter "theta" and "rho" describe the coordinates in accumulation matrix, which is converted from x-y coordinate from the formular in the Vorlesung page 8, 9
   . The disadvantage of using "a" and "b" in the formular y = ax + b is: to list all for lines coming through each point (x, y) the value range of a is (-limit, +limit), 
								          which is by machine very time-consuming
   . By using "theta" and "rho": for each point (x, y) the value range of "theta" is limited in (-2*pi, +2*pi)

b) Accumulatormatrix is the matrix, which has coordinaten convert from original input to appropiate coordinaten.

c) Small circle in the edge image (Kantenbild) tend to contain lots more noise than big circle ( certainly with appropiate threshold, the amount of noise will be reduce). 
   That's why big circle is much more easier to detect

d) . Of course, the high-dimensional paramter space for the Hough Transform is not only slow to implement, but also will outrun the available memory. 
   . In our recent exercise, consider the size of the input image is (m*n) 
   => Time complexity of circle detection using Hough-Transform is O(M*(m*n)^N), whereas M is the number of circle required to be detected, N is the number of parameters.
